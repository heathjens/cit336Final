            <p>There are many kind of sites. Deciding on the right site for your 
                business is an important decision that starts with what your 
                goal is for your website. The first question is what is your purpose 
                for creating this site? Is it to increase your business? Is it to 
                educate others? Once you have made this decision creating your site 
                becomes much easier. </p>
