            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>The target audience for my site are business owners. They work for a living
                and time is money. They are between the ages of 30-40. They are self- motivated,
                frugal, hard- working, passionate, and usually self-educated. They know that
                the more successful their business is the better they can take care of their
                family, so there is always a lot at risk. They understand how to use and 
                operate a computer and the internet. They usually know what they like and 
                can make decisions well. </p>

            <p>This site is for business owners who are seeking graphic design, web design, or 
                web development help. Most of the site is geared to sell a product, but some of it is 
                geared to help business owners find inspiration or information so that they can make 
                more informed decisions. </p>
