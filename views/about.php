            <p>I am currently working on my Bachelor's Degree in Web Design and 
            Development with an emphasis in Design at Brigham Young University- Idaho.
            I plan to graduate in the spring of 2016. I love designing a dynamic website
            with an aesthetically pleasing layout. I enjoy being able to think my way out of 
            problems and the puzzle that is web design. In my free time, 
            I enjoy being outdoors, reading the classics, and spending time with my family.</p>
